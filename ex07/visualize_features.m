%% TDCV exercise on neural networks

function stop = visualize_features(x,optimValues,state)
% Visualize the features learned by the network using backpropagation
% The idea is to give the backward function an activation vector which sets
% the activation of a single neuron to 1 and all other activations to 0 and
% then backpropagate this activation to the input. To display the learned
% filter properly you should normalize it beforehand.
% The network should be available via the global variable net
% The input size is
    global net;
